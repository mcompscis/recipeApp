69173,96,kittencal s italian melt in your mouth meatballs,3,20.08.03,2,"cooking the meatballs in simmering pasta sauce  will not only add so much extra flavor to the sauce the meatballs will be melt-in-your-mouth tender, you may of course oven-bake the meatballs for about 25 minutes,  --- don't be afraid to add in more parmesan cheese and a little more milk, there is no need to measure exactly, this recipe is pretty much foolproof, leftover cooked meatballs make a wonderful pizza topping just slice thinly and freeze until ready to use ----- these also make wonderful juicy burgers shaped into patties-- for more of my tried and true recipes check out my food blog at www.kittencalskitchen.com","Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl. Shape into small meatballs. Drop the meatballs into simmering pasta sauce , do not stir for at least 20 minutes or you will risk breaking the meatballs.

63689,1005,my family s favorite sloppy joes  pizza joes,2,05.06.03,2,"i've tried many recipes, this is the best. i once 'dec-tupled' (10x) this recipe to sell sandwiches at a craft fair at my church. people were waiting in line to buy leftovers. freezes well, goes up to the lake or camping well and is a hit on halloween...it's no-fail. easy to double, triple, etc. i've been making joes this way for over 20 years.
***03-08-09, i just reinvented this recipe tonight when i went to make it for dinner and found i didn't have an 8-oz. can of tomato sauce (shame on me).  the family was upset with me when i subbed an 8-oz. can of pizza sauce and told them to suck it up and call them 'pizza joes' and then served them up with shredded mozzarella cheese on the toasted buns, top and bottom.  they loved it.  i left out the bbq sauce in this preparation and just used a 1/2 cup ketchup.  pizza joes are good to go!","In a large skillet , brown ground beef , celery and onion.

"Other than using all chicken thighs, I made this recipe as written.  Excellent flavor!  This is my first time preparing an Ethiopian dish and have been searching for more Ethiopian recipes since.  Thank you for submitting!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Doro Delish! Sooo good! We're glad we made a huge batch of Recipe#91929 so we can make this again. I substituted chicken breast to keep the fat down but my husband thought it was a little dried out. Next time we'll use chicken on the bone as suggested. The sauce is really, really good - the egg seems kind of odd (which comes first, the chicken or the egg?) but when it sits in the sauce it's really, really good!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
